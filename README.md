The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) has a transformative effect in addressing NP-hard optimization problems.
However they can be challenging to comprehend due to their intricate nature and complexity.The task at hand is to leverage GA to optimize timetable scheduling
accommodating several constraints.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for optimized university timetable scheduling is implemented.
user-friendly interface to ensure ease of interaction for administrators, faculty, and students has been developed
GA performance has been enhanced through local search mechanism by performing small perturbations to the current solution to explore nearby feasible solutions,
potentially addressing soft constraint violations without disrupting the entire timetable.
